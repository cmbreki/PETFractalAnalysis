   An application implementing  Fractal and Multifractal analysis on  PET/CT .dcm images.

This program had been created as part of my bachelor thesis. It implements the Box Counting Method  and  calculates the Generalized dimensions on PET images. The image file format is .dcm ( DICOM ).

How to Compile and Run:
-  make
- ./loader <images path>

1. The program  takes as command line argument the path to the directory that includes the .dcm images. 
2. Reads each image in the directory and stores in an 3D array the pixel values for each one.
3. Then implements the Box Counting Method and exports the results in a .dat file for further possessing. The main goal is the calculation of the fractal dimension in 3D space by fitting the method results and plot them in a double logarithmic scale . The method is been repeated  for different box sizes from 1 to 50.
4. Implements the Box Counting Method considering the physical dimensions.
5. Calculates the Generalized Dimensions for -20 < q < 20 . The results are exported in a .dat file in order to be plotted (Multifractal spectrum).
